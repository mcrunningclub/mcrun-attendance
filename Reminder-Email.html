    Hi headrunner!
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a friendly reminder to submit today's headrun attendance.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Please use the McRUN app to log it. If you encounter difficulties, 
      you can access the <?= SEMESTER ?> attendance form <a href= <?= LINK ?> \> here</a>.
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Please ignore this message if the headrun has been cancelled or your group has already submitted the attendance
    form.
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>
      Thank you for all your help! McRun only runs because of you.
